# Redactr - Content Redaction App

Redactr is a web application designed to help users redact specific words within a text, offering the flexibility to replace these words with custom characters. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for content redaction.

## Project Description

Redactr enables users to input text in a form field and specify particular words or phrases they want to redact. The application allows users to choose replacement characters such as asterisks, question marks, dashes, underscores, or even custom characters to obscure the identified content. Through the user interface, the app provides statistical insights, indicating the number of words scanned, the quantity of words redacted, the total characters scrambled, and the time taken to perform the redaction.

### Advanced Features

- Selection of replacement characters: Users can choose from preset characters or input a custom character for redaction.
- Display Statistics: The app displays statistics, including the number of words scanned, words redacted, characters scrambled, and the time taken for the redaction process.
- Responsiveness: The app is designed to be responsive across various devices.

## How to Use

1. **Input Text**: Enter the text you want to redact into the "Enter the text you want to redact" text area.
2. **Specify Words**: Enter the words to be redacted (separated by spaces) in the "Words to be redacted" input field.
3. **Choose Replacement Character**: Select the replacement character from the dropdown menu. Choose "Custom" to input a unique replacement character.
4. **Redact Now**: Click the "Redact Now" button to perform the redaction.
5. **View Redacted Text and Statistics**: The redacted text and statistics will be displayed under the respective sections.

## Example

For instance, if you have the following text and words to redact:

- Text:

``` An effective way to redact texts ```

- Words to redact:

``` effective to ```

Choosing the asterisk (*) as the replacement character should result in the following redacted text:

```An ********* way ** redact texts```
